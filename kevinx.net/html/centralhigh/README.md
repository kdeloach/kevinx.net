Content management system developed in 2005 for Central High School while
I was a student there in my Junior year. This CMS powered our school
website and was used by thousands of students and staff daily.

The CMS was a very ambition project and had many features:

* Users, profiles, groups, roles, permissions
* Recursive page editor (tree-like data model)
* Mailing lists (email)
* Image uploads, user galleries, file manager, moderation tools
* Daily bullitin parser, upload, and search
* Relational schema for teachers, departments, clubs, etc.
* Homepage blog
* Sub-websites manager for departments, clubs, alumni 
* Access logs, user auditing

This project contains many errors, antipatterns, SQL injection vulnerabilities,
and more. It is the epitome of bad programming that PHP has become known
for from that era. Despite this, it's one of the projects I'm most proud of.
The lessons learned from this project have become invaluable to me.

I am publishing this merely for nostalgia's sake.
